Here is a snippit from the book about the author 
Jesse Stay began his career at age 10 as a developer writing BASIC programs in his spare time. 
He would frequently be found copying programs from the back of 3-2-1 Contact magazines and reading ahead,
way ahead, in the books of his computer programming classes in high school. 
In third grade, Stay won third place in his elementary school computer fair,
going against the likes of kids several years older than he was. 
For his Boy Scout Eagle Scout project, Stay wrote a computer program in Pascal to help track the
blood types of those in his local church congregation.
